# containing both the OracledDCPatch tweak (injected into devicecheckd) and
# the aaoracled CLI/daemon + its LaunchDaemon plist. Matches the
# ~/repositories/geoshim pattern, not a bare scp'd binary (that gets
# SIGKILLed at launch on this device; see entitlements.plist / Makefile
# comments for why).
#
# On Linux/macOS, just run this directly. On Windows, run it inside WSL as
# a LOGIN shell (for $THEOS + ldid on PATH), e.g.:
#   wsl -d <your-distro> -e bash -lc '/mnt/c/path/to/oracled/build_and_sign.sh'
# See SETUP.md step 9.
